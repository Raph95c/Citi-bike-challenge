Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Links to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data Links to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Conclusion 
In 2013, between July and September, we have notices the increase of Citi-bike users. It was on a good way to make the city more eco-responsible. Citi-bike program has a potential to be a successful story in NYC with a dynamic population who are more responsible for the environment.
